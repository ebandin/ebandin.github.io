            <p> 
                I believe what drives a person is a good measure of their character. 
                <br />I am powered by innovation. I try to make it so that new experiences and lessons are a constant in my life. I live for the opportunity to explore the world from muse to muse. Some examples these oasis' of inspiration are as follows:

<br />
               Poi in all of it's forms as the practice of flow and inner harmony. Poi has been used for many years as a method of improving balance and strength for a variety of purposes. Indigenous tribes have been known to use this tool, which is essentially a ball on a string, as a method of training rhythm and combat skills.

            Your dreams. My dreams. A pet's dreams. All dreams can be good dreams if considered critically and applied positively. From the days of Freud our culture has become aware of the psychological implications of dreams. In my lifetime I hope to help encourage those around me to learn from their dreams and realize their potential.

                <br />
        A good story. Whether I'm on the Alligator beat or kicking back with friends my eyes are always open for a good tale. I enjoy writing fiction as a hobby, although I've yet to publish any work to prove it. When I do so I will be sure to link them here!
